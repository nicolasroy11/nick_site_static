										<span class="initial">M</span>y name is Nicolas Roy. I was born in Montreal, and lived there until the age of 13. I then moved to Los Angeles and 
										have lived here ever since. I am fluent in French and English. I am also sufficiently fluent in Spanish to make your average Angeleno think that I am fluent in Spanish. I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, as well as some ongoing graduate coursework at the same institution. I graduated in December 2010. 
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">M</span>y degree was focused specifically in hardware, and the first couple of jobs I had reflected my interest in it. As the years went by, however, I began to gravitate towards jobs that involved programming in any capacity, whether scripting VB6 for die-testing machines or making C firmware for 8051 chips controlling switching devices and touch screen UX.
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">M</span>y last job title was 'programmer' for CMLRW Security. This is a company out of Denver that specialized in automation for high security places, mostly jails. My job there consisted in programming HMIs (Human Machine interface) for jail staffers. I also programmed PLC hardware that communicated with the HMIs. The HMI part was done in Indusoft using VBScript, but 80% of the HMI/PLC tasks were repetitive enough that I just wrote Excel VBA script to automate them. My automation templates were popular with management and are still in use at the office.
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">T</span>he original arrangement with this company was that I would work remotely, and I did for almost 2 years. The freedom of working remotely meant that I could travel without having to take vacation time. In fact, for the duration of my employment at CMLRW, I did not make use of any of it. My fianc√©e and I visited 7 countries in all. All the while, I am proud to say, I did not miss a beat in my projects, and was never late to a single online meeting!
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">T</span>he flip side of working for CMLRW is that it afforded me an intimate look at the goings on in your typical American jail setting. I grew rather close to some of the guards and became privy to the more sordid bits of information regarding prisoners as well as other staffers at each jail. 
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">S</span>ome tales have the sobering ability to jar you back into reality if you had any faith in human nature. These tales had that in spades. Although I would do well to avoid going into detail about most of what I heard, I can say that being a prison guard is not for everyone. I can also say that I would never marry a female guard working at a jail, given how common it is for intimacy to develop between female guards and male inmates, with absolutely disastrous results for everyone involved (think deadly venereal diseases for all).
										<br>
										<br>
										<span class="initial">I</span> left CMLRW when new management decided that remote work was no longer tolerable. I was asked to move to Denver, but refused and was discharged as a result.
